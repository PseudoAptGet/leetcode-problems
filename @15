intuition: 
- Just create a hashmap that contains all the integers seen so far. If there's a duplicate along the way (you know there's a duplicate because the hashmap 
  contains the value from a previous index of the array), then return true. Else iterate through the entire thing (and because no duplicates were detected),
  return false. 

class Solution {
    public boolean containsDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        HashSet<Integer> digitTracker = new HashSet<Integer>();
        
        // iterate through the arr
        for(int curNum : nums) {
            // if digit in hashmap, was seen before -> fail
            if (digitTracker.contains(curNum)) {
                return true; 
            } else {
                digitTracker.add(curNum);
            }
        }
        
        // went through entire arr without repetition. SHould pass then.
        return false; 
    }
}
